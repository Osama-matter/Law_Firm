# The Law Firm - ASP.NET MVC Project

This is a professional website for a law firm, built with ASP.NET MVC. It is designed to be modern, responsive, and easily customizable.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Includes a hero section and previews for About, Services, and Contact sections.
- **About Page**: Describes the law firm's history and mission.
- **Services Page**: Lists the legal services offered, with descriptions.
- **Contact Page**: A functional contact form with validation.
- **Map Page**: Shows multiple office locations with links to Google Maps.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Open the solution file** (`Law_Firm.sln`) in Visual Studio.
2.  **Restore NuGet packages** if they are not restored automatically.
3.  **Press `F5` or click the "Run" button** to start the application.

## Customization

- **Services**: To add or modify services, edit the `ServicesController.cs` file. The sample data is hardcoded for this example, but you can easily connect it to a database.
- **Locations**: To add or change office locations, update the `MapController.cs` file.
- **Styling**: All custom styles are in `wwwroot/css/site.css`. You can modify this file to change the look and feel of the website.
- **Images**: The hero image and other images are placeholders. Replace them with your own images to personalize the site.
